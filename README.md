Here's how you can create a simple Streamlit application tailored for a hair stylist business run by a sole proprietor. This application will include:

1. **Basic Information**: Displaying business details.
2. **Services Offered**: A list of services with prices.
3. **Appointment Booking**: A form for clients to book appointments.
4. **Contact Information**: A section for contact details.

5. ### Instructions:

1. **Setup Streamlit**: If you haven't already, install Streamlit:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Run the Script**: Save the above code in a file named `app.py` and run it:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
